Weather App!
In this challenge, I have created a real time, working weather application that gives you accuarte humidity, wind speed and temperature of any specified city.
Here is an image of the website.

As well as current temperature, wind speed and humidity for the current day, the application also presents the forecast for the next 5 days.
I have also used the API provided to us in the module 6 challenge to fetch the weather data for the current day, as well as the next 5 days.
As well as fetching the correct weather information, I implemented a function using javascript to log an error message when an invalid city name has been typed and searched for. 
If the user tries to input an invalid city name, the error message "Failed to fetch weather data" will be presented and the user must input a valid city name if they want accurate weather forecasts for their specified city.
Also using CSS, I have made the website easier to read and understand. Each day has been put in to it's own little division box where all the information is neatly organized and prevents screen clutter.
The HTML is very short, but it's neat and it provides accurate code to ensure that both the javascript works properly and that the CSS makes the page look appealing. It's short, sweet and to the point!
